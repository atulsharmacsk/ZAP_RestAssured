# ZAP_RestAssured

Zap Automation-Using RestAssured in place of zapClientAPI.

Benefits:- 
No need to learn way of traversing the complex zapClientAPI responses, instead we can 
just traverse the json.
If you are familiar with Rest assured, we just need to hit the zap end points to automate the Zap.
In zapClientAPI, we were passing unneccessary paramters to methods even if those were not required but via restassured we can send only the required parameters in form of query parameters.

Agenda-
1. Compare the RestAssured way of Automation with zapClient API way of Automation.
2. Perform a basic active scan & report generation using RestAssured.
